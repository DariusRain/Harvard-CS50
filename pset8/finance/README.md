# [CS50 Finance](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/finance/)
In this project tasks are to complete API endpoints using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and most of the <br />
applicaton file was allready written.  For the front end this project uses [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates) <br />
a templating engine made for python, making it easy for rendering lists of object with just jinja syntax within html markup. Used SQL/sqlite for database, <br />
where there where two tables users and ledger which store all the data needed. <br />
